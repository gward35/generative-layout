                        <p>Butterflies and moths are part of the class of insects in the order 
                            Lepidoptera. Butterflies are flying insects with large scaly wings. 
                            Like all insects, they have six jointed legs and three body parts: 
                            the head, the thorax and the abdomen. The wings are attached to the 
                            thorax and they also have a pair of antennae, compound eyes and an 
                            exoskeleton.

                        <p>Speaking of caterpillars, how much do you know about the life cycle 
                            of a butterfly? The butterfly starts its life as an egg, laid on a 
                            leaf. The caterpillar (larva) hatches from the egg and eats leaves 
                            or flowers. It loses its skin many times as it grows, increasing 
                            greatly in size. Eventually it turns into a pupa, or chrysalis 
                            and finally a beautiful adult butterfly emerges and the cycle 
                            continues.

                        <p>The Cabbage White is the most common butterfly in the U.S. 
                            Although it appears mostly white with black markings on the top of 
                            its wings, underneath those wings are yellowish-green. These 
                            butterflies have a wing spread of just about two inches. Males 
                            have only one spot on each wing, while females have two. As you 
                            probably know, you can find Cabbage Whites in most open spaces, 
                            including gardens, roadsides, parks and cities.
